<h3 class="caption">Pickles Ripe for Suckling</h3>
<p>Claussen Pickles are dill pickles at their crunchiest, saltiest best! These homemade Claussen pickles taste just like the commercial ones you find at the store, if not better.</p>
<p>Whether you’re new to pickle making or a pickle veteran, you NEED to make these refrigerator pickles! And wonder of wonders, you don’t need to know how to can to make these super fresh, crunchy pickles!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>35 to 40 small to medium pickling cucumbers</li>
    <li>1 gallon cold water</li>
    <li>1 cup cider vinegar, preferably raw</li>
    <li>2/3 c. coarse canning or kosher salt Do NOT fine or use iodized salt!</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic or more to taste</li>
    <li>4 fresh dill heads ~or~ 4 tablespoons dried dill seed not weed!</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons mixed pickling spices</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Wash cucumbers but do not scrub them.</li>
    <br><li>Trim 1/8-inch from the blossom end of each cucumber and slice in half lengthwise or into quarters, depending on how large your cucumbers are and how big you want them to be when they’re done.</li>
    <br><li>In a gallon jar (or large, wide-mouth, food-safe container) layer the dill heads or seed, garlic cloves, pickling spices and sliced cucumbers.</li>
    <br><li>In a separate pitcher or bowl, stir together the remaining ingredients until the salt is dissolved.</li>
    <br><li>Pour the brine over the cucumbers, taking care to make sure all of them are fully submerged. If needed, place a plate or mug or other non-reactive heavy item on the cucumbers to weigh them down and keep them under the brine!</li>
    <br><li>Cover lightly with a lid just perched on top or secure a piece of cheesecloth over the jar with a rubber band to keep fruit flies away.</li>
    <br><li>Leave out of direct sunlight on the counter for two to four days*, or until the cucumbers taste like pickles throughout.</li>
    <br><li>Fix your lid onto your jar or container and chill. These can be stored in the refrigerator for up to six months provided you keep them covered with brine.</li>
    <br><li>*If at any point in the proceedings “fuzz” or “foam” develops on top of the brine, use a spoon to remove it. If there is “fuzz” attached to any of the cucumbers, remove the ones affected and be sure the others are still fully submerged.</li>
